  /**
   * Answers:
   * Extra: how come you can just print all of these datatypes? The println method will check the data type and find an appropriate way to deal with it
   * Extra: why are those called primitive data types? They are defined in the java type system and have one purpose â€” containing pure, simple values of a kind. You cannot define new operations on them
   * Extra: why can't you assign a double to an integer? Because Java is a strongly typed language
   * Very extra: but why can you assign an integer to a char? Because char (characters) is only a representation of a number. See character encoding ect
   * Very extra: Why can't you assign a long to a int? A long is a datatype of 64 bits, while an int is only 32 bits. That means that a long can be too long for an
   * int variable to contain. But an int can always fit in a long.
